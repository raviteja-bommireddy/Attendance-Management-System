****Understanding the Idea****

Students enroll in a course under a professor, triggering the setup for attendance management. Every day, Monday to Friday, a unique QR code is sent to the professorâ€™s email at 8 AM, along with a button that allows the professor to activate or deactivate attendance collection for that day. If the professor activates the attendance collection, students can scan the QR code to access a Google Form. On the form, students must enter their roll numbers, which are validated against their registered email IDs. If the roll number and email ID match, the student is marked as present. Attendance is automatically recorded in a Google Sheet, where student roll numbers are listed as rows, and working days are tracked as columns. This process ensures an efficient and accurate attendance management system for both students and professors.

**Professor's Control**: The email contains a button allowing the professor to activate or deactivate attendance collection for that day. (professor will get a mail at a fixed time everyday, let's say morning 8AM)---

**QR Presentation**: Students scan the QR code (if activated) to access a Google Form.---

**Google Form Validation**: Students fill in their roll numbers, validated by their registered email IDs.---

**Attendance Record**: Google Sheets maintains a table with student roll numbers as rows and working days as columns.---
