****Understanding the Idea****



**Enrollment**: Students enroll in a course under a professor, triggering setup for attendance management.
**Daily QR Code**: A unique QR code is sent to the professor's email daily. (Monday to Friday)
**Professor's Control**: The email contains a button allowing the professor to activate or deactivate attendance collection for that day. (professor will get a mail at a fixed time everyday, let's say morning 8AM)
**QR Presentation**: Students scan the QR code (if activated) to access a Google Form.
**Google Form Validation**: Students fill in their roll numbers, validated by their registered email IDs.
**Attendance Record**: Google Sheets maintains a table with student roll numbers as rows and working days as columns.
